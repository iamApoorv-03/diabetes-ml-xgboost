#  Diabetes Prediction Using XGBoost + SMOTE  
*A Complete End-to-End Machine Learning System with Explainability, API, and Streamlit UI*

---

##  Project Overview

Diabetes is one of the most rapidly increasing chronic diseases worldwide. Early prediction enables timely lifestyle changes and clinical interventions.  
Using the classical **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, this project builds a **clinically meaningful, interpretable, and deployable machine learning system** for diabetes risk prediction.

This is not just a model — it is a **full ML pipeline**, including:

- ✔ Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- ✔ Imbalanced data handling using **SMOTE**  
- ✔ Model training with **XGBoost** and multiple baselines  
- ✔ Threshold optimization (Balanced & High-Sensitivity modes)  
- ✔ SHAP-based medical interpretability  
- ✔ Error analysis for safety-critical understanding  
- ✔ Deployable **FastAPI backend**  
- ✔ **Streamlit Web Application**  
- ✔ Structured folder architecture for industry use  
- ✔ Production-ready model export (pickle + json)

This work is structured for **research internship applications**, demonstrating both technical rigor and real-world deployment capability.

#  Why This Problem Matters

- Diabetes often remains undetected until late stages.  
- Traditional clinical cutoffs (e.g., fasting glucose) miss borderline patients.  
- A machine learning system that uses **all available clinical and lifestyle features** can detect risk earlier.  
- But medical datasets are imbalanced — models risk high false negatives.  
- Hence, this project focuses on:
  - Sensitivity (recall)
  - Interpretability (SHAP)
  - Dual-threshold clinical decision modes

---

#  Key Innovations

###  1. **Imbalanced Learning with SMOTE**
Medical datasets often have fewer positive cases (diabetic patients).  
SMOTE generates synthetic minority samples → improves recall, stability, F1-score.

###  2. **Dual Threshold System**
Real hospitals use different decision modes:

| Mode | Use-case | Goal |
|------|----------|------|
| **Balanced Mode (Threshold ~0.51)** | Normal screening | Balanced precision–recall |
| **High-Sensitivity Mode (Threshold ~0.19)** | High-risk populations | Maximum recall, minimal false negatives |

###  3. **SHAP Clinical Explainability**
Doctors must understand *why* the model predicted diabetes.

SHAP provides:  
✔ Feature importance bars  
✔ Patient-level waterfall plots  
✔ Dependence plots  
✔ Global beeswarm summary

###  4. **Full Deployment Pipeline**
Includes:

- FastAPI backend for inference  
- Streamlit UI with:
  - A fully interactive form  
  - Interpretation graphics  
  - Live probability and confidence  
- Docker & modular structure

#  Dataset Summary

This project uses the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, containing:

- **768 patients**
- **8 clinical features**
- **Outcome variable:** Diabetes (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Features include:
- Pregnancies  
- Glucose  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age  

---

#  Machine Learning Pipeline

## **1. Data Cleaning**
- Identified medical impossibilities (e.g., glucose = 0)
- Replaced zeros with `NaN` in relevant features
- Added missing-flag indicators for:
  - Glucose
  - BloodPressure
  - SkinThickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI

## **2. Feature Engineering**
Created 17 new medically meaningful features, including:

- `Glucose_Insulin_Product`  
- `BMI_Age_Interaction`  
- `BMI_per_Age`  
- `High_Glucose` flag  
- `HOMA_IR` (Insulin resistance index)  
- Log-transformed features  
- Square-root insulin  
- Age/Glucose interaction  
- Missing-value flags  

Final feature count: **25**

## **3. Train-Test Split**
- 80/20 split
- Standard Scaling
- SMOTE only applied to training set

## **4. Models Trained**
Baseline:
- Logistic Regression (balanced)
- Random Forest (balanced)

With SMOTE:
- Logistic Regression + SMOTE  
- Random Forest + SMOTE  
- SVM (RBF) + SMOTE  
- **XGBoost + SMOTE (Best)**

#  Final Model Performance

### **XGBoost + SMOTE (Best Model)**

| Metric | Score |
|--------|--------|
| Accuracy | **0.766** |
| Precision | **0.660** |
| Recall | **0.740** |
| F1-Score | **0.689** |
| ROC–AUC | **0.89** |
| PR–AUC | **0.70** |

---

#  Threshold Optimization

Two clinical operating modes were derived:

### ** Balanced Mode (Threshold ≈ 0.51)**
- Good precision & recall  
- Recommended for general population screening  

### ** High-Sensitivity Mode (Threshold ≈ 0.19)**
- Much higher recall  
- For high-risk patients  
- Designed to minimize false negatives  

---

#  Error Analysis (Safety Critical)

We analyzed failures at both thresholds.

### **False Negatives (FN) Patterns**
- Low glucose but high BMI  
- Missing insulin data  
- Lower skin thickness  
- Younger patients with poor indicators  

### **False Positives (FP) Patterns**
- High insulin  
- High glucose  
- High BMI  
- High interaction features  

We used SHAP to examine **root causes** of errors → ensures clinical reliability.

#  SHAP Explainability

### Global Importance
Top features influencing diabetes prediction:
1. Glucose  
2. BMI  
3. Pregnancies  
4. Insulin  
5. BloodPressure  

### Patient-Level Explanation
The waterfall plot shows how each feature pushes the prediction towards diabetic or non-diabetic.

### Dependence Plots (clinical insights)
- Higher Glucose sharply increases risk  
- BMI strongly affects diabetic probability  
- Insulin interacts with Glucose nonlinearly  
- Pregnancies influence risk in older women
